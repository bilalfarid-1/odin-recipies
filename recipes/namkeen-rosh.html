    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bakray ka gosht (Mutton) 2 Kg or as required cut into big pieces</li>
        <li>Charbi (fat of meat) 150 grams</li>
        <li>Namak (Salt) 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Dar cheeni (Cinnamon) 3 pieces</li>
        <li>Sabit Kali mirch (Black pepper corns) 10-15</li>
        <li>Tamatar (Tomato) 2 we need to use these without cutting</li>
        <li>Piyaz (Onion) 1 large peel it but do not cut it</li>
        <li>Adrak (Ginger) 1 Inch piece peeled</li>
        <li>Hari Mirchain (Green Chillies) 2-3</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the meat thoroughly under running water. Pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Rub the salt evenly over the surface of the meat using your hands. Ensure all sides are well-coated.</li>
            <li>Cut the charbi (fat of meat) into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Place the charbi in the bottom of a large pot or Dutch oven you will be using to cook the rosh.</li>
            <li>Arrange the meat pieces in a single layer on top of the charbi.</li>
            <li>Add the whole tomatoes and whole onion to the pot, along with the dar chini (cinnamon sticks), whole ginger (adrak), and whole black peppercorns (sabit kali mirch).</li>
            <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid.</li>
            <li>Place a heavy weight on top of the lid to create pressure and prevent steam from escaping.</li>
            <li>Cook the meat on low heat for 2 hours, checking on it after 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Add water only if necessary, if you feel the meat is drying out before fully cooked.</li>
            <li>After 2-2.5 hours, or when the meat is completely tender, add the whole green chilies (sabut hari mirch) to the pot.</li>
            <li>Re-cover the pot and cook for an additional 10 minutes to allow the aroma of the green chilies to infuse the rosh.</li>
            <li>Your Quetta rosh is now ready to serve alongside naan. Enjoy!</li>
            <li>**Note:** Adjust the salt quantity to your preference, but avoid adding chilies as this recipe is traditionally not spicy.</li>
          </ol>
    </ol>
