    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash 1 cup of black eyed beans in lukewarm water and soak it either overnight or at least for a couple of hours. Drain the water and pour fresh lukewarm water covering the black eyed beans and cook them till they smash with a press of a finger.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. When hot, add in the tomatoes and garlic paste. Bhuno (It's a technique of cooking in the Indian subcontinent where the spices and vegetables are roasted in the oil without adding water till fragrant or cooked. Either this process is done over medium flame to avoid burning of the spices or veggies or just enough water is added to prevent burning.)</li>
        <li>Once the tomatoes are soft and aromatics fragrant, add in the roasted cumin powder, red chilli flakes, and black pepper powder. Roast the spices lightly along with the remaining ingredients in the pan for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in the boiled black eyed beans and mix well.</li>
        <li>Now add onions, fresh coriander, slit green chillies, and juice of the lime. Mix. Add water as much as gravy as you require.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook on dum (cooks in its own steam) on medium flame for at least 5 mins.</li>
       </ol>
